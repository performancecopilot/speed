// Package bytebuffer implements a java like bytebuffer for go
//
// initially tried to use bytes.Buffer but the main restriction with that is that
// it does not allow the freedom to move around in the buffer. Further, it always
// writes at the end of the buffer
//
// another attempt was to maintain a position identifier that was always passed
// to any function that wrote anything and the function *had* to return the
// next writable location, which resulted in calls like
//
//	pos = writeString(buffer, pos, "mmv")
//
// which became unmaintainable after a while, and along with all the side
// maintenance looked extremely ugly
//
// this (tries) to implement a minimal buffer wrapper that gives the freedom
// to move around and write anywhere you want
package bytebuffer
